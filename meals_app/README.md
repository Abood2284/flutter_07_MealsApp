A new Flutter project created under the guidance of udemy course section 7

# What i learned?
## Navigation basics
- "Screens" (or "Routes") are just widgets!
- The flutter navigator allows you to switch (push/pop/replace) between pages
- You can use named routes or unnamed routes
## Passing Data
- Data can be passed between pages via arguments(directly or via "arguments" key)
- Data can be passed back, too(read via Future)
- Data can be anything! (String, int, list, map etc)

## Tabs
- You can add tabs in the AppBar or at the bottom of the page
- Tabs allows you to switch between different stacks (i.e: no popping)

## Drawers & dialogs
- Drawers(side menus) also allow switch between different stacks
- Drawers and dialogs (e.g: alerts, modal bottom sheet) can be closed via Navigator.pop()
